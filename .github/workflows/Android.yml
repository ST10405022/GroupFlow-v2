      # Step 4: Build the project in debug mode (produces APK)
      - name: Build project
        run: ./gradlew assembleDebug

      # Step 5: Run Android lint checks to catch coding errors and styling issues
      #- name: Run lint

      # Step 6: Run unit tests (e.g., for domain logic or view models)
      #- name: Run unit tests

      # Step 7: Upload the generated APK as a build artifact so it can be downloaded
